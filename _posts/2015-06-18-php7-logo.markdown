After Vincent Pontier's [logo proposal][proposal] on Twitter, I spent
some days working on the logo in order to perfect some fine details and iron
out the kinks.

After finishing up, Vincent's response was, "Wow ;-) You're logo is AWESOME!
Better than mine." (I'm not even paraphrasing.) and suggested making it
available to all you lovely people.

You probably don't need to be bored with any more details, so here we are;
a PHP 7 logo by Peter Cowburn and Vincent Pontier.
