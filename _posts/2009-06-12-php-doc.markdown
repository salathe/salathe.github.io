This is just a very short update to announce quietly that I recently joined
the team of folks working on the [PHP documentation][docs].  It's another
step towards giving a little something back to the PHP community by adding
to and updating the constantly evolving docs which have helped me along for
so many years.  Incidentally, my first commit was too large to be sent out to
the mailing list tracking the changes to the documentation. Oops!
