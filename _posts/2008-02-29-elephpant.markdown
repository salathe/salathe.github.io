Well, a slightly less code-minded blog entry now just noting the hugely
momentous occasion that is the arrival of my very own ElePHPant.
 For those not in the know, he's quite simply a plush toy version of the
 infamous PHP elephant logo.  For tonnes of fun pics, you can take a look at
 [ElePHPant on Flickr][flickr].

Here's a quick pic of my own ElePHPant reading a French book printed in
the 1940s:

Right now, he's sitting atop the screen on my Macbook Pro, making sure I don't
make any spelling mistakes. :)

P.S. Whilst we're on the not-so-serious side of posting, I finally upgraded
to OS X 10.5 (Leopard) this week. I spent the best part of a day backing up
essential files and documents only to have the installation process go super
smooth without so much as a hiccup. Thanks Apple!
